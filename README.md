# PYNK: Python Neon Keyboard firmware

This project is intended to create a new firmware for custom mechanical
keyboards, in a nimilar may as QMK or ZMK. Contrary to these firmwares,
this one will be implemented using Python instead of C/C++. This is able
to do thanks to CircuitPython, a firmware supported by several microcontrollers
that reads and interpret Python code.
