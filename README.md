# PYNK: Python Neon Keyboard firmware

This project is intended to create a new firmware for custom mechanical
keyboards, in a similar way as QMK or ZMK. Contrary to these firmwares,
this one will be implemented using Python instead of C/C++. This is 
being abled to do thanks to CircuitPython, a firmware supported by 
several microcontrollers that reads and interpret Python code.
